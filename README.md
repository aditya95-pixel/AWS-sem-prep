1(a) What is Server Consolidation?

Server consolidation is the process of reducing the number of physical servers in an IT environment by using virtualization. Instead of running multiple applications on separate physical servers, virtualization allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine. This optimizes resource utilization, reduces power consumption, lowers hardware costs, and simplifies management.

Benefits of Server Consolidation:

Cost Savings: Fewer physical servers reduce hardware, maintenance, and power costs.

Efficient Resource Utilization: CPU, memory, and storage are better utilized.

Simplified Management: Centralized control and easier updates.

Scalability: Can easily scale workloads without adding new physical machines.
