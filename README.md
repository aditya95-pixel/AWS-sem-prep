# AWS Semester preparation
## Mod 1
### 1(a) Write two advantages of perceiving infrastructure as software in the Cloud environment rather than as hardware in the traditional IT environment.

1. **Scalability and Flexibility**
   - Infrastructure as software allows for dynamic provisioning and scaling of resources based on demand.
   - Unlike traditional hardware setups, cloud infrastructure can be automated using scripts and APIs to quickly adapt to changing workloads.

2. **Automation and Efficiency**
   - Cloud environments support Infrastructure as Code (IaC), enabling automated deployments, updates, and configurations.
   - This reduces human error, speeds up development cycles, and ensures consistency across environments.

### 1(b)    _____-as-a-Service Services provides you with a completed product that the service provider runs and manages. Give two examples of the same.

Here are two common examples where the service provider delivers a fully managed, ready-to-use product:  

1. **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**  
   - Example: **Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Drive)**  
   - The provider manages everything (infrastructure, updates, security), and users access the software via the web.  

2. **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)**  
   - Example: **AWS Lambda**  
   - The cloud provider fully manages the execution environment, allowing users to deploy code without handling servers.  

Both eliminate the need for user-managed infrastructure, offering a turnkey solution.  

### 1(c)  A community cloud serves a group of Cloud Consumers with shared concerns such as _______, rather than serving a single organization as does a private cloud.

#### Community Cloud Shared Concerns  

A **community cloud** serves a group of cloud consumers with shared concerns such as:  

##### **Common Use Cases**  
1. **Industry-Specific Compliance** (e.g., healthcare organizations sharing HIPAA-compliant infrastructure).  
2. **Collaborative Research** (e.g., universities pooling resources for high-performance computing).  
3. **Government & Public Sector** (e.g., agencies sharing secure, sovereignty-aligned clouds).  

#### Key Difference vs. Private Cloud  
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated to a *single organization*.  
- **Community Cloud**: Shared by *multiple organizations with aligned needs*.  

Example: **NASA’s Nebula** (now OpenStack) was an early community cloud for scientific research.  

### 1(d) Describe the ownership dimension of the cloud cube model.

#### Cloud Cube Model: Ownership Dimension  

The **Ownership Dimension** classifies cloud deployments based on **who owns and controls** the infrastructure:  

#### Schematic Diagram

![alt text](https://github.com/aditya95-pixel/AWS-sem-prep/blob/main/cloudcube.png?raw=true))

#### **1. Internal (Owned)**  
- **Description**: The cloud is owned and operated *solely by the organization* (e.g., on-premises private cloud).  
- **Control**: Full autonomy over security, compliance, and customization.  
- **Example**: A bank running a private cloud for sensitive transactions.  

#### **2. External (3rd-Party Owned)**  
- **Description**: The cloud is owned and managed by a *public provider* (e.g., AWS, Azure).  
- **Control**: Less governance but offers scalability and cost efficiency.  
- **Example**: A startup hosting its SaaS product on Google Cloud.  

#### **Hybrid Ownership**  
- Combines internal and external clouds (e.g., sensitive data on-premises + burst workloads to AWS).  

#### Why It Matters?  
- **Security**: Internal clouds offer tighter control for regulated industries (e.g., healthcare).  
- **Cost**: External clouds reduce capital expenditure.

### 1(e) Write two disadvantages of using cloud computing.

# Disadvantages of Cloud Computing  

While cloud computing offers scalability and cost-efficiency, it also has some drawbacks:  

### 1. **Dependency on Internet Connectivity**  
   - **Issue**: Cloud services require a stable, high-speed internet connection.  
   - **Impact**: Downtime or slow connectivity disrupts access to critical applications and data.  
   - **Example**: Remote teams facing delays due to poor internet in rural areas.  

### 2. **Security and Compliance Risks**  
   - **Issue**: Shared infrastructure (in public clouds) increases exposure to cyber threats.  
   - **Impact**: Sensitive data may be vulnerable if misconfigured or attacked (e.g., data breaches).  
   - **Example**: Capital One’s 2019 breach due to a misconfigured AWS firewall.  

### Other Considerations:  
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Migrating between providers can be complex and costly.  
- **Hidden Costs**: Egress fees, premium support, or scaling expenses can add up.  

## Mod 2
### 1(a) What is Server Consolidation?

Server consolidation is the process of reducing the number of physical servers in an IT environment by using virtualization. Instead of running multiple applications on separate physical servers, virtualization allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine. This optimizes resource utilization, reduces power consumption, lowers hardware costs, and simplifies management.

**Benefits of Server Consolidation**:

Cost Savings: Fewer physical servers reduce hardware, maintenance, and power costs.

Efficient Resource Utilization: CPU, memory, and storage are better utilized.

Simplified Management: Centralized control and easier updates.

Scalability: Can easily scale workloads without adding new physical machines.


### 1(b) Distinguish Between Type I and Type II Hypervisors

**Type I Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor)**

Runs directly on the host machine's hardware.

Provides better performance and security.

Used in enterprise environments (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen).

**Type II Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)**

Runs on top of a host operating system.

More suitable for personal use and testing environments.

Examples include VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, and Parallels.

## Miscellaneous

### “Cloud Computing has evolved from mainframe, cluster computing, and grid computing and has features of each of these three technologies”---Comment on this statement.

Ans. 
**Mainframes:**
- These were the first examples of large computational facilities leveraging multiple processing units specialized for large data movement and massive input/output (I/O) operations.
- A supercomputer is designed for high-speed calculations and complex scientific computations, prioritizing raw processing power.

**Cluster Computing:**
- Cluster computing started as a low-cost alternative to the use of mainframes and supercomputers.
- One of the attractive features of clusters was that the computational power of commodity machines could be leveraged to solve problems that were previously manageable only on expensive supercomputers.

**Grid Computing**
- Grids were initially developed as aggregations of geographically dispersed clusters using Internet connections.
- These clusters belonged to different organizations, and arrangements were made among them to share the computational power. This is an analogy to the power grid.

**Cloud Computing**
- Computing clouds are deployed in large data centers hosted by a single organization that provides services to others.
- Clouds are characterized by the fact of having virtually infinite capacity, being tolerant to failures, and being always on, as in the case of mainframes.
- In many cases, the computing nodes that form the infrastructure of computing clouds are commodity machines, as in the case of clusters.
- The services made available by a cloud vendor are consumed on a pay-per-use basis, and clouds fully implement the utility vision introduced by grid computing.
